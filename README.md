## Projects made for P1xt's "Get Job Ready - Python Edition"

I learned some Python in class, mostly to do signal analysis with NumPy,
and I wanted to improve my skills further. I appeared to me that learning Django
could be a fun way to to do that as it's been a long time since I've done
Back-end Development. I already have some background in FrontEnd Development,
but thought that it couldn't do me harm to learn more Js.

So here you'll find most of what I've done for this course.
You can find the "curriculum" here : [Get Job Ready - Python Edition](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-python-edition.md)

*"Programming for the Web with JavaScript"*

Content :
* **Homework 2 - Javascript** (petstore.js) :

Some simple function. *Graded: 100%*

Making a calculator with JQuery. Rushed a bit on this one. *Graded: 81%*

### [Project: 3-Frontend2](3-Frontend2/)
*"Pick a template and implement the frontend of a website with it as your inspiration (do not use its assets)"*

Original website : **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/fr)**

As I couldn't find a template I really liked I decided to "copy" Stripe, As I really love their website.

I found a way to make a menu fully in CSS that used clip-path that I really liked :

### [Project: 4-toddmotto_API_Frontend](4-toddmotto_API_Frontend/)
*"Select an API from Todd Motto's API List and build a frontend-only application powered by data fetched from the API you chose."*

![Screenshot of Project4](4-toddmotto_API_Frontend/Screenshot.PNG)
API used :
* **[Open Notify](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/)**
* **[MediaWiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)**

The usage of the Open Notify one was very straightforward, as they gave everything with great example. The wikimedia one was harder, in the end I couldn't not get more than 3 pictures.. I also wanted to add an emoji with the nationality of the person pictured, but couldn't
find the property.

## In progress :
### [Course : 5-Advanced_HTML_CSS](5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/)
*"Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS"*

Content :
* [**Performance & Organization**](5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/lesson1.md) :

   Heavy emphasis on *OOCSS*, It might be better than my weird version of *BEM*,
but seems to be a bit much for small websites.

* [**Detailed Positioning**](5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/lesson2.md) :

   Not much that is new to me here. Still learned of a way to have a better
compatibility for the Clearfix.

* [**Complex Selectors**](5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/lesson3.md) :

   LOTS of selector that I didn't or vaguely knew. I especially love the Attributes
selector.

### [Course : 6-D3js](6-D3js/)
*"Data Visualization and D3.js"*

Content :
* [**Note on design**](6-D3js/note_design.md) :

   The most important thing I learned regarding to Design in this course.

* [**Note on Code**](6-D3js/note_code.md) :

   The most important thing I learned regarding to Programming, and making chart
on the web, in this course.

I forgot to take note of the first section. Might have to add that later.
