## Projects made for P1xt's "Get Job Ready - Python Edition"

I learned some Python in class, mostly to do signal analysis with NumPy,
and I wanted to improve my skills further. I appeared to me that learning Django
could be a fun way to to do that as it's been a long time since I've done
Back-end Development. I already have some background in FrontEnd Development,
but thought that it couldn't do me harm to learn more Js.

So here you'll find most of what I've done for this course.
You can find the "curriculum" here : [Get Job Ready - Python Edition](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-python-edition.md).

The demos are here : [thomasdargent.com](http://thomasdargent.com/P1xt/demos_viewer/viewer.html)

## Tier 1 - Non-Python frontend necessities for Web Development

### [Project : 1-Frontend1](Tier1-FrontEnd/1-Frontend1/)
*"Pick a template and implement the frontend of a website with it as your inspiration (do not use its assets)"*

![Screenshot of Frontend1](Tier1-FrontEnd//1-Frontend1/Screenshot.png)
Original template : **[Savory by GetTemplates.co](https://freehtml5.co/demos/savory/)**

**Demo : [Frontend1](http://thomasdargent.com/P1xt/1-Frontend1/index.html)**

### [Course : 2-js_Edx](Tier1-FrontEnd/2-jsEdx/)
*"Programming for the Web with JavaScript"*

Content :
* **Homework 2 - Javascript** (petstore.js) :

Some simple function. *Graded: 100%*
* **Homework 3 - jQuery** (calc.js) :

Making a calculator with JQuery. Rushed a bit on this one. *Graded: 81%*

**Demo : [Calculator](http://thomasdargent.com/P1xt/2-js_Edx/calc.html)**

* **Homework 4 - React** (FontChooser.js) :

A UI to modify a text with React. First time using React and it was really fun. *Graded: 100%*
* **Homework 5 - React** (hW5/) :

A list app with React. Not easy, but really showed me the power of React. *Graded: 100%*

### [Project: 3-Frontend2](Tier1-FrontEnd/3-Frontend2/)
*"Pick a template and implement the frontend of a website with it as your inspiration (do not use its assets)"*

![Screenshot of Frontend2](Tier1-FrontEnd/3-Frontend2/Screenshot.png)
Original website : **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/fr)**

**Demo : [Frontend 2](http://thomasdargent.com/P1xt/3-Frontend2/index.html)**

Since I couldn't find a template I really liked I decided to "copy" Stripe, As I really love their website.

I found a way to make a menu fully in CSS that used clip-path that I really liked :

### [Project: 4-toddmotto_API_Frontend](Tier1-FrontEnd/4-toddmotto_API_Frontend/)
*"Select an API from Todd Motto's API List and build a frontend-only application powered by data fetched from the API you chose."*

![Screenshot of Project4](Tier1-FrontEnd/4-toddmotto_API_Frontend/Screenshot.PNG)
API used :
* **[Open Notify](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/)**
* **[MediaWiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)**

**Demo : [ISS Localisation](http://thomasdargent.com/P1xt/4-toddmotto_API_Frontend/index.html)**

The usage of the Open Notify one was very straightforward, as they gave everything with great example. The wikimedia one was harder, in the end I couldn't not get more than 3 pictures.. I also wanted to add an emoji with the nationality of the person pictured, but couldn't
find the property.

### [Course : 5-Advanced_HTML_CSS](Tier1-FrontEnd/5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/)
*"Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS"*

Content :
* [**Performance & Organization**](Tier1-FrontEnd/5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/lesson1.md) :

   Heavy emphasis on *OOCSS*, It might be better than my weird version of *BEM*, but seems to be a bit much for small websites.

* [**Detailed Positioning**](Tier1-FrontEnd/5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/lesson2.md) :

   Not much that is new to me here. Still learned of a way to have a better compatibility for the Clearfix.

* [**Complex Selectors**](Tier1-FrontEnd/5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/lesson3.md) :

   LOTS of selector that I didn't or vaguely knew. I especially love the Attributes selector.

* [**Responsive Web Design**](Tier1-FrontEnd/5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/lesson4.md) :

   Cool fix for responsive iframe. Learned about the viewport tag
   and Mobile First Web Design.

* [**Preprocessors**](Tier1-FrontEnd/5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/lesson5.md) :

   Always feared to learn those. I don't really like haml.. But SASS/SCSS looks
   awesome. I'll try it on my next project I think.

* [**Transforms**](Tier1-FrontEnd/5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/lesson7.md) :

   Learned about some interesting 3D property. I made an ["hypercube"](Tier1-FrontEnd/5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/Test/cube.html) to test those. **[Demo's here](http://thomasdargent.com/P1xt/5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/Test/cube.html)**
   ![Cube](Tier1-FrontEnd//5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/Test/Screenshot.png) :
* [**Transitions & Animations**](Tier1-FrontEnd/5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/lesson8.md) :
   Good reminder about animation

* [**Extending Semantics & Accessibility**](Tier1-FrontEnd/5-Advanced_HTML_CSS/lesson10.md) :
   Learned about a lot of tags. And about microdata and WAI-ARIA

### [Course : 6-D3js](Tier1-FrontEnd/6-D3js/)
*"Data Visualization and D3.js"*

Content :
* [**Note on design**](Tier1-FrontEnd/6-D3js/note_design.md) :

   The most important thing I learned regarding to Design in this course.

* [**Note on Code**](Tier1-FrontEnd/6-D3js/note_code.md) :

   The most important thing I learned regarding to Programming, and making chart
on the web, in this course.

* [**Project 2**](Tier1-FrontEnd/6-D3js/Project/Mini_Project2) : A redesign of [this chart](http://www.designyourway.net/diverse/2/wronginfo/60373947977.jpg) with dimple.js.
   [**Demo's here**](http://thomasdargent.com/P1xt/6-D3js/Project/Mini_Project2/index.html)

I forgot to take note of the first sections. Might have to add that later.

## Tier 2-Python Basics:

###  Challenge: Python on HackerRank
I was already doing the main python course of HackerRank, and found that doing the Python interview prep took a lot of time (mostly because of the number of exercises); So I chose to keep doing the main one.

**Progress:** 45% (profile accessible here: [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/thomasdargent))

### ON HOLD
Currently doing an internship with a heavy focus on webdevelopment, so I chose to spend my free time doing something else (Namely the third tier).
