# job-ready-project

I started by doing The P1xt "[Get Job Ready - Python Edition](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-python-edition.md)" cursus to improve my python skills. As time went by, this has sort of become my "Ultimate course list" : What I would have wanted to follow, and what I mostly did, to become a data scientist.

* [ ] Finish all original Codingame challenges in the medium category by the end of the Tier

#### Machine Learning
* [x] **P1XT** [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-6)
* [x] [Machine Learning is fun](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471)
* [x] **P1XT** [Intro to ML](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)
* [x] **P1XT** [Kaggle: ML from disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) (just do better than random)
* [ ] **P1XT** Do 10 problems on [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)

#### Deep Learning
* [x] [Fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning For Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
    * [x] Publish at least one project using the library on the forum.
* [ ] **P1XT** Do 1 competitions on [Crowdanalytix](https://www.crowdanalytix.com/community)
* [ ] **P1XT** Complete [Deep Learning With Tensorflow](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/deep-learning-tensorflow)
* [x] [Neural Network and Deep Learning - Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) *You might benefit from reading the annotations of the [Fermat Library](https://fermatslibrary.com/list/neural-networks-and-deep-learning)*
* [ ] [Fast.ai - Deep Learning from the Foundations](https://course.fast.ai/part2)
* [ ] Code a basic deep learning library : Stochastic gradient descent, dense layers with differents type of units (Sigmoid, ReLU, tanh..), and convolutive layers. It would be great to implement some useful methods such as learning rate finder, one cycle policy, some regularizers, and discriminative learning rate. The API should be inspired by what you saw of Fast.ai, Tensorflow, and what M. Nielsen made.
* [ ] **P1XT** [Thinks Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf)
* [x] [Intro to pandas data structures 1, 2 & 3](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/)
    * [x] Use Pandas to exploit a dataset of your choice and make a working model (classic ML or deep learning) using the datas.
* [ ] **P1XT** Participate in one [Bot Programming](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming) competition.
* [ ] Ian goodfellow's Deep learning (https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf/blob/master/complete-book-pdf/deeplearningbook.pdf)
* [ ] **P1XT** Do 10 problems on [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)
* [x] Learn Latex mathematical notation and markdown by formatting some of your writing. Export those to pdf with pandoc and experiments with some themes.

So I made this to learn, while there's some issues that I have already spotted and will fix upon the completion of the course, I would love to hear your thoughts. Bad ones or good ones, anything that could help my learning.
