# Bachelor in a hurry

## Goals :
I started by doing The P1xt "[Get Job Ready - Python Edition](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-python-edition.md)" cursus to improve my python skills. As time went by, this has sort of become my "Ultimate course list" : What I would have wanted to follow, and what I mostly did, to become a data scientist.

---

## Tier 1 - Non-Python frontend necessities for Web Development

* [x] [Tensorflow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/)
* [x] [Fast.ai - Cutting Edge Deep Learning For Coders](https://course.fast.ai/part2.html)
    * [ ] Code a basic deep learning library : Stochastic gradient descent, dense layers with differents type of units (Sigmoid, ReLU, tanh..), and convolutive layers. It would be great to implement some useful methods such as learning rate finder, one cycle policy, some regularizers, and discriminative learning rate. The API should be inspired by what you saw of Fast.ai and what M. Nielsen made.
* [x] [Intro to pandas data structures 1, 2 & 3](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/)

* [ ] [Typing club](https://www.typingclub.com/) and [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) to learn touch typing. At first touch type only during those exercise, but switch to full time when you get to a good 20wpm on the full keyboard. This will avoid pain in your hands.

## Tier 4 - Research
Now you should be quite good in python, so we'll dig into more programming languages. You could work on a programming language in parallel to the sciences courses, or not. In any case, try to avoid doing more than two courses/project at the same time.
As the following items are long, and includes a lot of reading you can do them in any order you want, and work on multiple items at once. Make sure to do only one project/competition at once however to stay focused.

Then you can focus on the domains interesting to you.
    * As you'll be reading papers, Read [this tutorial on how to read them](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf) and after each write a short review following [How to Write Technical Paper Reviews](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Paper-Reviews/) and/or do flashcards [Augmenting Long term memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)
