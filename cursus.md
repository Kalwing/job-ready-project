# Bachelor in a hurry

## Goals :
I started by doing The P1xt "[Get Job Ready - Python Edition](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-python-edition.md)" cursus to improve my python skills. As time went by, this has sort of become my "Ultimate course list" : What I would have wanted to follow, and what I mostly did, to become a data scientist.

---

## Tier 1 - Non-Python frontend necessities for Web Development
Here you'll learn programming, and how to present your work. You'll improve most of your projects if you find a way of putting them on the web. Even if you don't want to be a web developer, do not skip this tier.
