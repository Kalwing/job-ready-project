# Bachelor in a hurry

## Goals :
I started by doing The P1xt "[Get Job Ready - Python Edition](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-python-edition.md)" cursus to improve my python skills. As time went by, this has sort of become my "Ultimate course list" : What I would have wanted to follow, and what I mostly did, to become a data scientist.

---

## Tier 1 - Non-Python frontend necessities for Web Development
Here you'll learn programming, and how to present your work. You'll improve most of your projects if you find a way of putting them on the web. Even if you don't want to be a web developer, do not skip this tier.

## Tier 2 - Python Basics and algorithms
* [ ] Book: Work through PythonTricks by the end of the Tier
* [x] Finish all original Codingame challenges in the easy category by the end of the Tier
* [x] **P1XT** Challenge: Python Interview Prep on Hackerrank. Sign up now and work problems alongside the guide as you progress.
* [x] **P1XT** Study: [the Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/)

## Tier 3 - More Python, Machine Learning and data science

* Makes flashcards of the formulas, the concepts... You might want to read [Augmenting long term memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) to help you. The concepts here might be very foreign and heavy, so don't skip this.  
* [x] Video: Work through [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&v=kjBOesZCoqc)

### Machine Learning
* [x] **P1XT** [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-6)
* [x] [Machine Learning is fun](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471)
* [x] **P1XT** [Intro to ML](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)

### Deep Learning
* [x] [Fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning For Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
    * [x] Publish at least one project using the library on the forum.

    * [ ] Code a basic deep learning library : Stochastic gradient descent, dense layers with differents type of units (Sigmoid, ReLU, tanh..), and convolutive layers. It would be great to implement some useful methods such as learning rate finder, one cycle policy, some regularizers, and discriminative learning rate. The API should be inspired by what you saw of Fast.ai and what M. Nielsen made.
* [x] [Intro to pandas data structures 1, 2 & 3](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/)

* [x] Learn Latex mathematical notation and markdown by formatting some of your writing. Export those to pdf with pandoc and experiments with some themes.
* [ ] [Typing club](https://www.typingclub.com/) and [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) to learn touch typing. At first touch type only during those exercise, but switch to full time when you get to a good 20wpm on the full keyboard. This will avoid pain in your hands.

As the following items are long, and includes a lot of reading you can do them in any order you want, and work on multiple items at once. Make sure to do only one project/competition at once however to stay focused.

* [ ] **P1XT** [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/past_rounds/228440181128818/) year of your choice (that you haven't previously completed)
* [ ] [Deep Learning Papers Reading Roadmap](https://github.com/floodsung/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap) You don't have to read *everything*, but you should read most of what is before the application section (Reinforcement Learning will be seen in more details later, so if those seems too hard skip them.). Then you can focus on the domains interesting to you.
    * As you'll be reading papers, Read [this tutorial on how to read them](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/01/how-read-scientific-paper) and after each write a short review following [How to Write Technical Paper Reviews](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Paper-Reviews/) and/or do flashcards [Augmenting Long term memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)
* [ ] Write one scientific articles AND multiple blog post explaining a project you made.
* [ ] Learn Vim (be sure to have *at least* 20wpm when touch typing, before starting this): [How To Learn Vim: A Four Week Plan](https://medium.com/actualize-network/how-to-learn-vim-a-four-week-plan-cd8b376a9b85)
* [ ] Continue improving your typing speed: [Typing.io](https://typing.io/lesson/) and [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/), aim for a 40-50wpm score.
* [ ] [Fast.ai - Computational linear algebra](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/blob/master/README.md)
* [ ] [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/march2019?utm_campaign=NLP%20News&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)
* [ ] **P1XT** Complete one competition of your choice on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?sortBy=prize&group=active&page=1&pageSize=20)    

## Tier 4: Getting Professional
Now you should be quite good in python, so we'll dig into more programming languages. You could work on a programming language in parallel to the sciences courses, or not. In any case, try to avoid doing more than two courses/project at the same time.
