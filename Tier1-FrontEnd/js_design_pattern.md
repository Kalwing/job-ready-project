# Learning JavaScript Design Patterns
## Preface

Design patterns's origin : the work of C. Alexander. He published a book *A pattern Language*
that described pattern leading to a optimal effect in architecture.

It was formalized for programming in 1995 by a group nicknamed "the gang of
four" in their book : *Design Patterns: Elements Of Reusable Object-Oriented
Software"*.

This book will show a few popular js pattern.

## What is a Pattern ?

*A pattern is a reusable solution that can be applied to commonly occurring
problems in software design.*

Their benefits :
* **Pattern are proven solution**
* **They can be easily reused**
* **They can be expressive** (more elegant)

**Pattern aren't exact solution. It's a solution scheme.**

## "Pattern"-ity Testing, Proto-Patterns & The Rule Of Three

**Proto-Patterns** are patterns that hasn't been vetted heavily yet.
It may also lack a good documentation and just stay a **patlet** (ed: wtf are those naming convention ?!)

A good pattern has to do the following :
* **Solve a particular problem**
* **The solution to this problem cannot be obvious**
* **The concept must have been proven** : A pattern without proof cannot be
seriously considered
* **It must describe a relationship**

Additional requirements (**The rule of three**) :
The pattern must demonstrate:
* **Fitness of purpose** - how is the pattern considered successful?
* **Usefulness** - why is the pattern considered successful?
* **Applicability** - is the design worthy of being a pattern because it has wider applicability? If so, this needs to be explained. When reviewing or defining a pattern, it is important to keep the above in mind.

## Structure of a patterns

A pattern is initially presented in the form of a rule that establishes a relationship between:
* A context
* A system of forces that arises in that context and
* A configuration that allows these forces to resolve themselves in context
